       <h1>For First Assignment, downloaded Github, signup, download VS code, created first repos, used code ass public,
        publish for github online.</h1></p><br />
        <p>From VS code, update the index.html and commit it, then push it for github.
            Give an access to Mr. Aamir in collaborator -> Manage access.
            Note, i saw it during creating the repository / project profile if you use private code, collaborate option is hidden. 
            It is only showed in when the code is public.
        </p><br />
    Collaborate Manage access used for to share code for more then 1 developer!   
<br />
        Now the session starts for deploying!

        install node.js I used for windows. 

        open node.js prompt command! 
        >npm --version 
            6.14.4

        >node --version
            v12.17.0
            
        surge will install in nnode.js command prompt, use commad
        npm install --global surge
        
        if you get error on installation of surge, just run the command 'npm cache --force clean'

        then re-run command 'npm install --global surge'

        Once surge install, just run command surge, it will ask credenstials of gethib account, just provide and log-in
